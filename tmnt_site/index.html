  	<p>When I was a kid, I was obsessed with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>. My favorite turtle was, of course, Michelangelo. Here's why I loved him...</p>

  	<ol>
  		<li>His uniform was orange. Orange is the best color.</li>
  		<li>He loved pizza. Pizza is the best food.</li>
  		<li>He had funny sayings, like, "Cowabunga, dude!"</li>
  	</ol>
